# Porfolio

Live page https://tanim-iqbal.github.io/Porfolio/

This is a MVP portfolio page made for most of my projects I do during the course of this full-stack development bootcamp. I hope to rebuild this page to look more professional and to have a few more features once I am completely comfortable with full stack development, but for now this will do as a placeholder.
